    Polymorphism:
        -One Name and multiple forms
        -eg: Function Overloading, Operator Overloading,
             Virtual Functions

    Compile time Polymorphism:
    To understand in context of function overloading:
        1)Say u have an object in which there are 3 member functions with the same name "add(...)" but each
        of these have a unique "address".

        2)So, in compile time polymorphism, the compiler binds which function will be run when at compile
        time i.e it binds 1 address (out of 3 possible) of the function to when it is supposed to run during
        compile time itself.

        3)The binding means the process of converting identifiers into addresses. 
        For each variables and functions this binding is done. 
        For functions it is matching the call with the right function definition by the compiler. 
        The binding is done either at compile time or at runtime.

        3)Same goes for operator overloading.
